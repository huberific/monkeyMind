# Monkey Mind
Monkey Mind is a terminal game where the player helps a lab monkey named Henry solve memory puzzles located in 4 rooms. With each room, the challenge becomes more difficult. If each room can be solved within 90 seconds, Henry earns a banana!

This game was programmed using C++11 for Oregon State's CS 162 final project.
